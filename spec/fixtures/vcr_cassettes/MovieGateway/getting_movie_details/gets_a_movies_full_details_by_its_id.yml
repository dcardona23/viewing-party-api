        I'm writing this review, Darth Vader's theme music begins to build in my mind...)\\r\\n\\r\\nWell,
        it actually has a title, what the Darth Vader theme. And that title is \\\"The
        Imperial March\\\", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of
        you may already know, also composed the theme music for \\\"Jaws\\\" - that
        legendary score simply titled, \\\"Main Title (Theme From Jaws)\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNow,
        with that lil' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently
        under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois
        town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly
        \\\"Movie Date Night\\\" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece
        from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared
        to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able
        to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even
        had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle,
        of course, from the wide-opened cinema's briefly distant concession stand.
        Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the
        time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother
        sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this
        movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going
        to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable,
        but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn't
        believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself
        intrigued ... And awed.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal,
        and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han,
        Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series,
        and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda,
        and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas's phenomenal
        imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings.
        Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ...
        And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I'll admit that I am a huge lover
        of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets
        ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera;
        it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my
        brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even
        received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that
        my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon
        and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath
        our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the
        new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nI
        don't personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly
        doesn't suggest there are still a few people out there who haven't. And if
        you're one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera
        comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you'll definitely
        want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes
        Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you'll too discover
        yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. \U0001F60A\",\"created_at\":\"2017-02-13

        long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\\r\\n\\r\\nPrincess Leia
        is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the
        Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \\\"Obi-Wan\\\" Kenobi
        may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke
        Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi
        sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and
        all who dwell within it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old
        boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no
        idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers
        previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two
        whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly
        cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very
        day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken
        on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars
        proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point
        to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus
        evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures
        most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not,
        because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to
        youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits
        of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here),
        it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach,
        and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering
        for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th
        Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most
        pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on
        the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure
        laden entertainment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is by definition one of the most successful
        films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in
        what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie,
        he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as
        amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern
        day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time
        or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing
        that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability
        to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something
        that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event
        to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like
        hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down
        no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10\",\"created_at\":\"2019-07-21

        quality start to the franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say start, I guess that depends
        on the (seemingly) controversial way of watching these films - I've decided
        on release order, so it's the beginning for me anyway. I've heard a lot about
        <em>'Star Wars'</em> so I am expecting big things, this didn't disappoint
        whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nI unquestionably enjoyed this! If I didn't know this
        was released in 1977 I would never have guessed, it still holds up astonishingly
        well. The special effects are spectacular for the vast, vast majority; even
        the stuff that perhaps hasn't aged as supremely still looks superb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe
        cast are a joy. I actually wouldn't say any performance sensationally stood
        out, but all the actors and all the characters are so much fun to watch together.
        Mark Hamill is impressive as Luke, Harrison Ford is entertaining as Han and
        Carrie Fisher is super as Leia. Credit also to James Earl Jones and Alec Guinness,
        among others. Despite not watching until now, I literally already knew all
        of the character names - shows how timeless these are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot
        makes for top notch viewing, I found the pacing to be particularly spot on.
        And how about that score? Stupendous! I really have no negatives for this,
        I'm sure it isn't perfect but I had a very fun time with it.\",\"created_at\":\"2021-02-01

        and their mother is going to write reviews about the Star Wars movies...and
        this one, this one actually came out before I was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breaks
        the heart. I had to wait until the re-release before I got to see this one
        on the big screen. This is the one that ruined my Star Wars opening night
        streak...\\r\\n\\r\\n...Well The Force Awakens ALMOST ruined it further. I
        had to drive out to my parents house just to see it, for the sake of tradition,
        and when I got there they had already gone without me...twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome
        angry words later and I guilted my mom, pointing out the drive, to force her
        into a third go.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is neither here nor there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis
        was the movie that started it all. And the first time I saw it, it was on
        Beta. Once upon a time my family had the movie in Beta. And then I had the
        trilogy in VHS. And then I had it on DVD. And it is going to repeat like that
        as the mediums change.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts one of those movies that you have to
        own, even as technology changes. It is actually one of those movies you want
        to buy right away when the technology changes, just to see it in better and
        better quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat should be saying something right there. But
        for a lot of you its not.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest of you, it is a fairy tale
        in space, complete with knights and old wizards and a princess. Only its a
        fairy tale in space made for, well, made for nerds like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt
        is a legend and the type of legend that stays with people and makes old Gen-Xers
        like me, cynical and grumpy, feel like little kids again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt, along
        with the Godfather, is the type of movie that breeds mental spousal abuse
        as generations of men force their wives at gunpoint to watch them...and then
        get confused and a little depressed when most of them don't see the fascination
        with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the Godfather, however, its the movie that fathers
        force their children to watch and, then, their children carry the love for
        it into the next generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Wars is an endless cycle, even
        the bad ones are good. And the fans create endless theories about them. They
        buy the t-shirts, the buy the toys, they do everything they can to preserve
        that love and pass it on.\\r\\n\\r\\nA New Hope, this is the film that started
        all of that, and though there are better installments, this will always be
        the first.\",\"created_at\":\"2023-01-14 02:41:03 UTC\",\"id\":\"63c2163f05a53300e99bfdd1\",\"updated_at\":\"2023-01-14
