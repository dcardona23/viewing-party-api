        an ex-military sniper who is quickly brought into custody. The interrogation
        yields one written note: ''Get Jack Reacher!''. Reacher, an enigmatic ex-Army
        investigator, believes the authorities have the right man but agrees to help
        the sniper''s defense attorney. However, the more Reacher delves into the
        case, the less clear-cut it appears. So begins an extraordinary chase for
        the truth, pitting Jack Reacher against an unexpected enemy, with a skill
        for violence and a secret to keep.","popularity":63.484,"poster_path":"/uQBbjrLVsUibWxNDGA4Czzo8lwz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount
